It's a tool that can generate and validate new lexical categories on demand through deep learning and a corpus of more than 1.8 billion words. What's cool about it is that it was built to be a reverse-engineered version of the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count [LIWC], which has been used for psychometric applications and research. You can read more about LIWC here, and the Empath whitepaper can also be found here. |
