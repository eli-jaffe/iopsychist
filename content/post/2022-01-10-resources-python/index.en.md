I've gathered a number of resources which have helped me at various stages in my journey into Python and programming. By and large, the order in which they are presented reflects when I came into contact with them. All of them helped my understanding in some way. Most of the resources listed here range from the beginner to intermediate level. Hopefully they can be of help as you progress along your own journey.
